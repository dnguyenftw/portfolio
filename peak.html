					<h1>Overview</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>Peak to Peak was a quarter long project worked on by myself and three other peers for our informatics class
					that focused on learning more about the process that goes behind user centered design. It allowed us to gain
				  a better understanding on human-computer interaction, design thinking, and incorporating the social side of
					technology in our design process. This project served as a way for us to see how designers practice responsibly
					by taking this project and going through each stage that goes on in the design cycle.</p>

              <div class="row">
                <p class="description col-md-6">The goal of this project is to investigate and address problems regarding information for a specific
                user group of our choosing. We had to figure out what group of people we wanted to serve and what problem
                area needs to be addressed for that user group. The end objective is to be able to take this information
                and create a product that will help address these issues. The project will consist of
                iterating through each design process in order to produce a viable solution for our problem.</p>

              <div class="row">
                <p class="description col-md-6">Since this was a group project, we started off brainstorming issues within
                areas of interests that we are familiar with. Before coming up with a specific user group, it was important
                to first decide on what general topic to look for information on. After deciding a user group, we
                would then create a problem statement by looking for issues regarding information technology that the user group
                is facing. After the problem statement we needed to know more about our users, so the next stage in our project dealt with user research.
                From there we then dove into drafting our design by sketching and wireframing our creation. Lastly we would then create a prototype
                which would then go under usability testing to hear feedback.</p>

                However some parts of the user research and final design stages were branched out and so we all worked on different aspects.
                During the user research, I focused on reaching out to members of the Washington Trails Association for their input. For the
                prototyping I assisted with the UI design on Figma and modeling a 3D variant of our product on SketchUp.</p>

                decided with a topic that is familiar to each of us, which is hiking. Because each of us has experience with hiking
                in the pacific northwest, it was easier for us to figure out what problems could hikers have in regards to
                information. The initial target group that my team drafted was Washington State hikers, with the problem being the
                lack of information regarding weather and obstacles while hiking. </p>

              <p class="description">To gain a better understanding of what issues we can help solve for hikers, we conducted brief
              research to find a key problem: The Washington Trails Association currently has trouble keeping up with trail

                methods for the sake of being able to gain a better understanding of the problem at hand. In the process,
                we were able to reach out to different individuals regarding our issue, and we proceeded to contact them
                through phone calls as well as emails.
                <br>
                <br>
                We created a Google form to ask hikers about their issues and opinions on hiking, and we made posts on Facebook
                asking hikers to fill out our form. This allowed us to better understand the needs and wants of hikers in our area,
                and the responses given gave us more information about how each hiker has a different opinion on the hike depending
                on their experiences with hiking. Beginner hikers would like to know more about gear related issues and preparation
                while the more experienced hikers were more concerned about the trailhead itself.

                working for the Washington Trails Association (WTA) who researches hikes to improve WTA’s hiking guide.
                 With Anna, we were able to learn a lot about what information new hikers lack and how that negatively
                impacts the organization as well as the hikers themselves. Specifically, we learned that:

                       hikers are often not prepared enough for their trip due to a substantial

                Joe Nelson (February 12, 2019) to learn more about their views on what critical information hikers often lack.
                We believe interviewing an REI representative would be a good fit for our research since REI is a prominent outdoor
                gear, rental, and classes store, as well as offering classes in various locations including beginner map and
                topography classes, and beginner tent and overnight classes. From Joe, we were able to learn a couple of problems that
                many beginner hikers encounter, being that they:

              <p class="description col-md-6">We learned in great detail regarding how beginner hikers misread weather conditions
                (if it’s getting foggy or starting to snow they often push on to get to the top), animal sightings,
                getting lost and not knowing the steps to take to be rescued (they don’t know how to bare down and
                set up camp/ how to, or keep wasting energy moving around or yelling).

              We've decided on an electronic information board that would be built near the entrance of the trailhead where hikers will
              typically find the route information. From there we decided to wireframe and sketch designs that would make this information

                passes for the hiking trail, being able to report any obstacles or hazards, and updated information on the trail.
                Users will be able to select the parking pass they want and make a direct purchase in which Peak to Peak will print
                out a pass for the user. Information of the trail includes weather conditions, terrain, what to expect on the trail,

            Through research and feedback, there is still a lot of flaws that need to be worked on. More research needs to be
            done to see how our product can be powered besides relying on solar energy, and proper UI design needs to be
            applied to our interface. Further usability testing is required and physical design changes need to be made as
            well. But overall the concept and purpose of the design meets our expectations and helps our chosen user group.
            Our team put in weeks of effort to research our users to better understand their problems, and drafted a product
            that can assist with their issues.</p>
