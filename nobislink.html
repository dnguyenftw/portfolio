					<h1>Overview</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>Nobislink is an android application that was created during a MLH hackathon at the University of Washington Bothell campus.
            It is an application that takes social networking to the physical world. After evaluation from MLH judges, the application has
            recieved a Most Socially Impacting award at the event. For more details on the application, feel free to check it out on the
            Google Play Store below.

              <h3 class="sub-section">Objective</h3>
              <p class="description">The goal of this project is to investigate and address problems regarding information for a specific
              user group of our choosing. We had to figure out what group of people we wanted to serve and what problem
              area needs to be addressed for that user group. The end objective is to be able to take this project and
              iterate through each design process in order to produce a viable solution for our problem.</p>

              <div class="row">
                <p class="description col-md-6">Since this was a group project, we started off brainstorming issues within
                areas of interests that we are familiar with. Before coming up with a specific user group, it was important
                to first decide on what general topic to look for information on. After deciding a user group, we
                would then create a problem statement by looking for issues regarding information technology that the user group
                is facing. After the problem statement we needed to know more about our users, so the next stage in our project dealt with user research.
                From there we then dove into drafting our design by sketching and wireframing our creation. Lastly we would then create a prototype
                which would then go under usability testing to hear feedback.</p>

                However some parts of the user research and final design stages were branched out and so we all worked on different aspects.
                During the user research, I focused on reaching out to members of the Washington Trails Association for their input. For the
                prototyping I assisted with the UI design on Figma and modeling a 3D variant of our product on SketchUp.</p>

                <p class="description col-md-6">Because we have the ability to pick a user group of our choosing, my team and I
                decided with a topic that is familiar to each of us, which is hiking. Because each of us has experience with hiking
                in the pacific northwest, it was easier for us to figure out what problems could hikers have in regards to
                information. The initial target group that my team drafted was Washington State hikers, with the problem being the
                lack of information regarding weather and obstacles while hiking. </p>

              <p class="description">To gain a better understanding of what issues we can help solve for hikers, we conducted brief
              research to find a key problem: The Washington Trails Association currently has trouble keeping up with trail
              maintenance. A lack of trail maintenance comes with unexpected hazards for hikers, therefore our team wanted to
              pursue this issue. </p>

            <p class="description">Overall there is still a lot of work needed to be done for this project to become reality.
            Through research and feedback, there is still a lot of flaws that need to be worked on. More research needs to be
            done to see how our product can be powered besides relying on solar energy, and proper UI design needs to be
            applied to our interface. Further usability testing is required and physical design changes need to be made as
            well. But overall the concept and purpose of the design meets our expectations and helps our chosen user group.
            Our team put in weeks of effort to research our users to better understand their problems, and draft a product
            that can assist with their issues.</p>
